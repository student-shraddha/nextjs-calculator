## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See the size of the elements adjust based on their device's screen size
- Perform mathmatical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Adjust the color theme based on their preference
- **Bonus**: Have their initial theme preference checked using `prefers-color-scheme` and have any additional changes saved in the browser

### What I learned

For the first time ever, besides having [dark mode in Sass](https://medium.com/@katiemctigue/how-to-create-a-dark-mode-in-sass-609f131a3995), I also detected, using JS, the user's preferred theme according to the system settings using the [matchMedia](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/matchMedia) method.
